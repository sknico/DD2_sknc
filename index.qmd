This website includes details about **The Danish Center for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes** (The **DD2** Study). The intention of this website is to document the data sources used for research and to ease the day-to-day work with DD2.

To learn more about DD2 please see: <https://dd2.dk/>

An extensive list of [scientific publications](https://dd2.dk/nyheder/categories/videnskabelige-publikationer) based on data from DD2 is available on the website. That said, a good place to start is the 2018 baseline paper [@Christensen_BMJOpen_2018].
