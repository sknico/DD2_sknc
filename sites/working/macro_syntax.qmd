Macros and programs/syntaxes

HOW TO WORK IN SAS!?!

**Simple versions of data:**

-   [LPR](): syntax to make a simple combination of data from LPR2 and LPR3 and create a simple data set including only dates and diagnoses.

-   

**Variable definitions:**

-   [GLD_classification](/sites/working/macro_syntax/GLD_classification.qmd): Classification of glucose-lowering drugs.

-   [FirstDiabDate](/sites/working/macro_syntax/FirstDiabDate.qmd): The first indication of diabetes, either as a hospitalization, glucose-lowering treatment initiation, or elevated HbA1c. In addition, enrollment in DD2 (or DDDA) is included as an indication for diabetes.

-   HOMA-phenotypes

-   ANDIS-phenotypes
