jeg har snakket med Lars, og han siger jeg gerne må lægge udtræksbeskrivelserne op. 

## Population

The DD2 data is uploaded to SDS, and they check the validity of the CPR-numbers before encrypting them. The data set `DS_EXT_DD2_POP` includes individuals with a valid CPR-number. Individuals with a non-valid CPR-number are still included in the uploaded data, e.g. in `DS_EXT_DD2CORE`, but they will have a missing encrypted CPR-number (`CPR_ENCRYPTED`) and can thus not be linked across data sources. 
Previously (when we had local data), we would notify DD2 (Odense) about non-valid CPR-numbers, but this is no longer possible as we are not allowed to identify the individuals based on individual-level data on the servers.
