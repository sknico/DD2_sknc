IDNC is short for "International Diabetic Neuropathy Consortium". Read more about it here: <https://idnc.au.dk/about-idnc>.

A list of 7,011 CPR-numbers from all individuals enrolled in DD2 by February were sent to the CPR registry to get their addresses. The only criteria to be included in the questionnaire study were that individuals should be enrolled in DD2 (February 2016), be alive (24 May 2016), and have a valid Danish address (24 May 2016). A total of 6,726 questionnaires were sent out in June 2016 (07 June 2016), and a reminder was sent in September 2016 (12 September 2016) and again in October 2016 (10 October 2016) to those who had not provided a response. A total of 5,755 questionnaires were returned during the fall of 2016 and the inclusion ended in January 2017 (24 January 2017). The questionnaire included questions about height, weight, smoking and alcohol, and physical activity. These questions were intended to be follow-up questions similar to those from the baseline questionnaire. In addition, the questionnaire included questions about falls, quality of life, sleep, mental health, neuropathy (in hand and feet) and pain. The questionnaire thus included the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire (MNSIq) and the Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions (DN4).

## Variables
The original questionnaire data included a total of around 109 variables (including some variables from the data cleaning process added by the working group). To ease working with data and to have some pre-defined variables/definitions, an additional 78 variables were created by the working group.

The questions and variable definitions for the original variables can be downloaded here:

### Data 
Data are stored locally at KEA and a slightly changed version has been uploaded to DST and SDS. The changes are mainly due to similar definitions of variables, variable names and labels, and to comply with the SDS/DST regulations.
