The full DD2 research data is based on data collected/linked from multiple sources. This page is intended to give an overview of the data structure, the data sources and the definitions of data types. Detailed description of each of the data sources can be found on the following pages.

::: {.callout-note appearance="default"}
Husk at vi i stedet for at kalde det "additional dd2 data" har valgt at kalde det "internal dd2 data". Så vil vi have core data (data fra index), internal data (det det kun bor i dd2), og external data (det der kommer fra anden kilde)

# DD2 core data

DD2 core data include the data that make the foundation of DD2. This includes

-   DD2 questionnaire data

-   Biomarker data (analysis results based on the blood and urine samples from time of enrollment). The blood/urine samples are stored in a biobank in Vejle.

To be enrolled in DD2, the individual fills out the DD2 questionnaire and a blood/urine sample is collected. The core data only exist in DD2 and the DD2 cohort is defined to be those who enrolled in the DD2 by answering the DD2 questionnaire. As the blood/urine samples are collected at enrollment and currently stored in a biobank, it holds potential for additional biomarker analyses, genetic analyses, DNA sequencing etc., which would only add to the core data.

# Internal DD2 data

Internal DD2 data include data from additional questionnaires and/or substudies. This includes data only available through DD2, meaning that it is data that had been generated only among individuals in DD2, but it was (probably) not collected as part of the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., include

-   IDNC questionnaire data, a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.

-   Birth data from Rigsarkivet collected from midwife journals. Data (*i.e.,* midwife journals) exist outside DD2 and could thus be considered external data, but it has only been registered electronically for individuals in DD2. For now, we consider it additional DD2 data as it is currently only (practically) available for individuals in DD2.

-   IDA, DICTA, CsubT2D, etc., are examples of projects initiated within DD2. These projects generate their own additional data and analyses but data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.

These data sources will probably not be updated with new individuals or additional data, as they are mostly generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts. Some of the substudies additionally contribute core data as they include analyses made on the blood/urine sample collected at enrollment.

# Data extracts from external data sources

Data from external data sources were not initially generated with the intention to be included in DD2. However, as data can be considered relevant for DD2 research questions, we have linked data from these external data sources to the DD2. In practice, this means that data (or a subset of data) has been handed over from the external data source to DD2, and we thus have relevant data on (a subset of) the individuals in DD2. Currently, we have agreements with the following external data sources:

-   DDDA (udgår)

-   DDiD (nyt, endnu ingen aftale)

-   Fodstatus

-   Diabase (øjenkompl., aftale?)

The general idea is that we can get updates of data from these data sources. Therefore, we will have the most recent data on the individuals in DD2 and also have updated data whenever we have new individuals in the DD2 cohort.

# Danish medical registry data

DD2 research data will be uploaded to the servers hosted at Danmarks Statistik (DST, Statistics Denmark) and Sundhedsdatastyrelsen (SDS, The Danish Health Data Authority). On these servers, we have access to Danish medical registry data, such as data from the CPR registry, hospital data from LPR, laboratory data from LAB-F etc.

-   SDS
