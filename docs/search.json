    "text": "This website includes details about The Danish Center for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (The DD2 Study). The intention of this website is to document the data sources used for research and to ease the day-to-day work with DD2. It is intended for employees at Department of Clinical Epidemiology (DCE/KEA), Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, as it is mainly describing the setup used at DCE. Other institutions can also gain access to DD2 data but their setup might be different.\nTo learn more about DD2 please see: https://dd2.dk/\nAn extensive list of scientific publications based on data from DD2 is available on the website. That said, a good place to start is the 2012 paper about the DD2 enrollment process Nielsen et al. (2012) or the 2018 baseline paper Christensen et al. (2018). We are currently working on an update of this paper.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChristensen DH, Nicolaisen SK, Berencsi K, Beck-Nielsen H, Rungby J, Friborg S, et al.

Read more about it here: https://idnc.au.dk/about-idnc.\nA list of 7,011 CPR-numbers from all individuals enrolled in DD2 by February were sent to the CPR registry to get their addresses. The only criteria to be included in the questionnaire study were that individuals should be enrolled in DD2 (February 2016), be alive (24 May 2016), and have a valid Danish address (24 May 2016). A total of 6,726 questionnaires were sent out in June 2016 (07 June 2016), and a reminder was sent in September 2016 (12 September 2016) and again in October 2016 (10 October 2016) to those who had not provided a response. A total of 5,755 questionnaires were returned during the fall of 2016 and the inclusion ended in January 2017 (24 January 2017). The questionnaire included questions about height, weight, smoking and alcohol, and physical activity. These questions were intended to be follow-up questions similar to those from the baseline questionnaire. In addition, the questionnaire included questions about falls, quality of life, sleep, mental health, feeling (in hand and feet) and pain. The questionnaire thus included the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire (MNSIq) and the Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions (DN4).\nRead more about the questionnaire in Gylfadottir et al.

The following sites include a detailed description of each of the data sources, whereas this site is intended to give an overview of the data structure, the data sources and the definitions of data types.\n\nDD2 core data\nDD2 core data include the data that make the foundation of DD2. This includes\n\nDD2 questionnaire data\nBiomarker data (analysis results based on the blood and urine samples from time of enrollment).\n\nTo be enrolled in DD2, the individual fills out the DD2 questionnaire and a blood/urine sample is collected. The core data only exist in DD2 and the DD2 cohort is defined to be those who enrolled in the DD2 by answering the DD2 questionnaire.\nAdditional DD2 data\nAdditional DD2 data include data from additional questionnaires and/or substudies. This includes data only available through DD2, meaning that it is data that had been generated only among individuals in DD2, but it was (probably) not collected as part of the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., include\n\nIDNC questionnaire data (follow-up questionnaire from 2016)\nFødselsdata from Rigsarkivet (birth data collected from midwife journals). Data (midwife journals) exist outside DD2 and could thus be considered external data, but it has only been registered electronically for individuals in DD2. For now, we consider it additional DD2 data as it is currently only (practically) available for individuals in DD2.\nIDA, DICTA, CsubT2D, etc., are examples of projects initiated within DD2. These projects generate their own additional data and analyses but data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.\n\nThe data sources will probably not be updated with new individuals, as they are mostly generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts.\nData extracts from external data sources\nData from external data sources were not initially generated with the intention to be included in DD2. However, as data can be considered relevant for DD2 research questions, we have linked data from these external data sources to the DD2. In practice, this means that data (or a subset of data) has been handed over from the external data source to DD2, and we thus have relevant data on (a subset) of the individuals in DD2. Currently, we have agreements with the following external data sources:\n\nDDDA (udgår)\nDDiD (nyt, endnu ingen aftale)\nFodstatus\nDiabase (øjenkompl., aftale?)\n\nThe general idea is that we can get updates of data from these data sources whenever we have new individual in the DD2 cohort.\nDanish medical registry data\nDD2 research data will be uploaded to the servers hosted at Danmarks Statistik (DST, Statistics Denmark) and Sundhedsdatastyrelsen (SDS, The Danish Health Data Authority). On these servers, we have access to Danish medical registry data, such as data from the CPR registry, hospital data from LPR, laboratory data from LAB-F etc.\n\nSDS\nDST\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview in DD2"

Previously (when we had local data), we would notify DD2 (Odense) about non-valid CPR-numbers, but this is no longer possible as we are not allowed to identify the individuals based on individual-level data on the servers.\nThe data files uploaded by us have the prefix DS_EXT_. Currently, data are uploadet in 2 versions; the initial upload version (without suffix) and the current version (with suffix _230601). The registry data are based on the population in the current version of data.

The following sites include a detailed description of each of the data sources, whereas this site is intended to give an overview of the data structure, the data sources and the definitions of data types.\n\nDD2 core data\nDD2 core data include the data that make the foundation of DD2. This includes\n\nDD2 questionnaire data\nBiomarker data (analysis results based on the blood and urine samples from time of enrollment). The blood/urine samples are stored in a biobank in Vejle.\n\nTo be enrolled in DD2, the individual fills out the DD2 questionnaire and a blood/urine sample is collected. The core data only exist in DD2 and the DD2 cohort is defined to be those who enrolled in the DD2 by answering the DD2 questionnaire. As the blood/urine samples are collected at enrollment and currently stored in a biobank, it hold potential for additional biomarker analyses, genetic analyses, DNA sequencing etc., which would only add to the core data.\nAdditional DD2 data\nAdditional DD2 data include data from additional questionnaires and/or substudies. This includes data only available through DD2, meaning that it is data that had been generated only among individuals in DD2, but it was (probably) not collected as part of the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., include\n\nIDNC questionnaire data, a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.\nFødselsdata from Rigsarkivet (birth data collected from midwife journals). Data (midwife journals) exist outside DD2 and could thus be considered external data, but it has only been registered electronically for individuals in DD2. For now, we consider it additional DD2 data as it is currently only (practically) available for individuals in DD2.\nIDA, DICTA, CsubT2D, etc., are examples of projects initiated within DD2. These projects generate their own additional data and analyses but data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.\n\nThe data sources will probably not be updated with new individuals, as they are mostly generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts.\nData extracts from external data sources\nData from external data sources were not initially generated with the intention to be included in DD2. However, as data can be considered relevant for DD2 research questions, we have linked data from these external data sources to the DD2. In practice, this means that data (or a subset of data) has been handed over from the external data source to DD2, and we thus have relevant data on (a subset) of the individuals in DD2. Currently, we have agreements with the following external data sources:\n\nDDDA (udgår)\nDDiD (nyt, endnu ingen aftale)\nFodstatus\nDiabase (øjenkompl., aftale?)\n\nThe general idea is that we can get updates of data from these data sources whenever we have new individual in the DD2 cohort.\nDanish medical registry data\nDD2 research data will be uploaded to the servers hosted at Danmarks Statistik (DST, Statistics Denmark) and Sundhedsdatastyrelsen (SDS, The Danish Health Data Authority). On these servers, we have access to Danish medical registry data, such as data from the CPR registry, hospital data from LPR, laboratory data from LAB-F etc.\n\nSDS\nDST\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview in DD2"
