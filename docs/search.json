The intention of this website is to document the data sources used for research and to ease the day-to-day work with DD2. It is intended for employees at Department of Clinical Epidemiology (DCE/KEA), Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, as it is mainly describing the setup used at DCE. Other institutions can also gain access to DD2 data but their setup might be different.\nTo learn more about DD2 please see: https://dd2.dk/\nAn extensive list of scientific publications based on data from DD2 is available on the website. That said, a good place to start is the 2012 paper about the DD2 enrollment process Nielsen et al. (2012) or the 2018 baseline paper Christensen et al. (2018). We are currently working on an update of this paper.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChristensen DH, Nicolaisen SK, Berencsi K, Beck-Nielsen H, Rungby J, Friborg S, et al.

    "text": "Variable documentation \nData from Danish midwife journals have been collected for all individuals enrolled in DD2 per 22 February 2022, i.e., a total of n=9,549 individuals. Data include information on birth weight, birth length, born at term (yes/no, and if no then also the number of weeks), and twin (yes/no).\nThe afleverings-/afslutningsrapport from Rigsarkivet (the Danish National Archive) can be downloaded here (Danish): Download \nThere is similar description in English in the electronic supplemental material from Hansen et al. (2023): Download \nCPR-numbers for a total of n=9,549 individuals were sent to Rigsarkivet and n=8,896 fulfilled the criteria for potentially having available birth information (born in the period from ~1920 to 1988, born in Denmark, and identifiable through the biological mother’s name). During the retrieval, data were uniformized (e.g., to include birth weight in grams and not pounds) and proofread.\nData include n=9,549 CPR-numbers (one CPR-number is included twice), n=8,346 have non-missing birth weight, and a total of n=8,364 had a non-missing value in at least one of the five birth variables.\nIn addition to the individuals from DD2, a control population was recorded. For every individual in DD2, two random individuals were selected based on the births from the same midwife information sheet (with birth information on ~6–8 different births). Controls from the same midwife record thus served as a match on date of birth, midwife, and geographical location. A total of n=18,210 individuals are recorded in the control population and data include information on year and month of birth, birth weight, birth length, sex, born at term, twin, and geographical location (lægekreds/fødselsamt). No CPR-numbers are available for the control population (data permissions and ethical and practical reasons) and neither are links between the controls and the individuals in DD2. Data on controls are currently not available on the servers1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpørgsmål til dokumentationen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeg kan se i afslutningsrapporten at Rigsarkivet har fået n=9549 cpr-numre de skulle tjekke, og så vidt jeg kan se er det \"hele DD2\". Ved du hvem der har dannet denne population og hvornår? Jeg har nemlig brug for at vide pr. hvilken dato det er hele DD2 (og om der alligevel er eventuelle eksklusionskriterier). Mit bedste gæt er 22. februar 2022, men jeg vil bare gerne have den korrekte dato, hvis det er muligt.\nI afslutningsrapporten står der også at ud af de n=9549 individer, kunne n=8896 dokumenteres, idet de opfyldte kriterierne (cpr, mor, Danmark osv.). Når jeg kigger i data er der non-missing data på n=8364 individer, så der må være 532 individer der af en eller anden grund ikke kunne findes i journalerne selvom de opfyldte kravene. Ved du om det er registreret hvem det er?\nMht. kontrollerne, så vil jeg høre om du har noget dokumentation på dem. Jeg har vist bare et datasæt, men ikke noget yderligere information om hvordan de er fundet. Jeg kan se i ESM til din artikel, at det er 2 individer fra samme side i journalen, og det er såmænd bare det jeg gerne vil have noget officielt dokumentation på. Derudover, så har vi ingen cpr-numre på kontrollerne, og så vidt jeg husker har du engang sagt at det var fordi vi ikke fik lov til at indsamle dem. Er det korrekt? Ved du om der også er en grund til man ikke har gemt hvilket individ fra DD2 hver kontrol tilhører?\nJeg kan også se at der er n=18,210 kontroller. Hvis der er fundet 2 pr. individ, så svarer det til 9105 individer i DD2, men det er jo ikke muligt, hvis de kun kunne dokumentere maksimalt n=8896. Ved du hvorfor det netop er dette antal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHansen AL, Thomsen RW, Brøns C, Svane HML, Jensen RT, Andersen MK, et al.

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10390374/pdf/125_2023_Article_5936.pdf\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThe current data permission includes only individuals in DD2 and therefore not the matched controls. As CPR-numbers are not available and controls ultimately cannot be linked to their respective DD2 individual there is no reason to upload data to the servers because all analyses can be performed locally.↩︎"

Read more about it here: https://idnc.au.dk/about-idnc.\nA list of 7,011 CPR-numbers from all individuals enrolled in DD2 by February were sent to the CPR registry to get their addresses. The only criteria to be included in the questionnaire study were that individuals should be enrolled in DD2 (February 2016), be alive (24 May 2016), and have a valid Danish address (24 May 2016). A total of 6,726 questionnaires were sent out in June 2016 (07 June 2016), and a reminder was sent in September 2016 (12 September 2016) and again in October 2016 (10 October 2016) to those who had not provided a response. A total of 5,755 questionnaires were returned during the fall of 2016 and the inclusion ended in January 2017 (24 January 2017). The questionnaire included questions about height, weight, smoking and alcohol, and physical activity. These questions were intended to be follow-up questions similar to those from the baseline questionnaire. In addition, the questionnaire included questions about falls, quality of life, sleep, mental health, neuropathy (in hand and feet) and pain. The questionnaire thus included the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire (MNSIq) and the Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions (DN4).\nRead more about the questionnaire in Gylfadottir et al.

The following sites include a detailed description of each of the data sources, whereas this site is intended to give an overview of the data structure, the data sources and the definitions of data types.\n\nDD2 core data\nDD2 core data include the data that make the foundation of DD2. This includes\n\nDD2 questionnaire data\nBiomarker data (analysis results based on the blood and urine samples from time of enrollment).\n\nTo be enrolled in DD2, the individual fills out the DD2 questionnaire and a blood/urine sample is collected. The core data only exist in DD2 and the DD2 cohort is defined to be those who enrolled in the DD2 by answering the DD2 questionnaire.\nAdditional DD2 data\nAdditional DD2 data include data from additional questionnaires and/or substudies. This includes data only available through DD2, meaning that it is data that had been generated only among individuals in DD2, but it was (probably) not collected as part of the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., include\n\nIDNC questionnaire data (follow-up questionnaire from 2016)\nFødselsdata from Rigsarkivet (birth data collected from midwife journals). Data (midwife journals) exist outside DD2 and could thus be considered external data, but it has only been registered electronically for individuals in DD2. For now, we consider it additional DD2 data as it is currently only (practically) available for individuals in DD2.\nIDA, DICTA, CsubT2D, etc., are examples of projects initiated within DD2. These projects generate their own additional data and analyses but data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.\n\nThe data sources will probably not be updated with new individuals, as they are mostly generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts.\nData extracts from external data sources\nData from external data sources were not initially generated with the intention to be included in DD2. However, as data can be considered relevant for DD2 research questions, we have linked data from these external data sources to the DD2. In practice, this means that data (or a subset of data) has been handed over from the external data source to DD2, and we thus have relevant data on (a subset) of the individuals in DD2. Currently, we have agreements with the following external data sources:\n\nDDDA (udgår)\nDDiD (nyt, endnu ingen aftale)\nFodstatus\nDiabase (øjenkompl., aftale?)\n\nThe general idea is that we can get updates of data from these data sources whenever we have new individual in the DD2 cohort.\nDanish medical registry data\nDD2 research data will be uploaded to the servers hosted at Danmarks Statistik (DST, Statistics Denmark) and Sundhedsdatastyrelsen (SDS, The Danish Health Data Authority). On these servers, we have access to Danish medical registry data, such as data from the CPR registry, hospital data from LPR, laboratory data from LAB-F etc.\n\nSDS\nDST\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview in DD2"

This page is intended to give an overview of the data structure, the data sources and the definitions of data types. Detailed description of each of the data sources can be found on the following pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHusk at vi i stedet for at kalde det “additional dd2 data” har valgt at kalde det “internal dd2 data”. Så vil vi have core data (data fra index), internal data (det det kun bor i dd2), og external data (det der kommer fra anden kilde)\n\n\n\nDD2 core data\nDD2 core data include the data that make the foundation of DD2. This includes\n\nDD2 questionnaire data\nBiomarker data (analysis results based on the blood and urine samples from time of enrollment). The blood/urine samples are stored in a biobank in Vejle.\n\nTo be enrolled in DD2, the individual fills out the DD2 questionnaire and a blood/urine sample is collected. The core data only exist in DD2 and the DD2 cohort is defined to be those who enrolled in the DD2 by answering the DD2 questionnaire. As the blood/urine samples are collected at enrollment and currently stored in a biobank, it holds potential for additional biomarker analyses, genetic analyses, DNA sequencing etc., which would only add to the core data.\n\n\nInternal DD2 data\nInternal DD2 data include data from additional questionnaires and/or substudies. This includes data only available through DD2, meaning that it is data that had been generated only among individuals in DD2, but it was (probably) not collected as part of the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., include\n\nIDNC questionnaire data, a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.\nBirth data from Rigsarkivet collected from midwife journals. Data (i.e., midwife journals) exist outside DD2 and could thus be considered external data, but it has only been registered electronically for individuals in DD2. For now, we consider it additional DD2 data as it is currently only (practically) available for individuals in DD2.\nIDA, DICTA, CsubT2D, etc., are examples of projects initiated within DD2. These projects generate their own additional data and analyses but data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.\n\nThese data sources will probably not be updated with new individuals or additional data, as they are mostly generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts. Some of the substudies additionally contribute core data as they include analyses made on the blood/urine sample collected at enrollment.\n\n\nData extracts from external data sources\nData from external data sources were not initially generated with the intention to be included in DD2. However, as data can be considered relevant for DD2 research questions, we have linked data from these external data sources to the DD2. In practice, this means that data (or a subset of data) has been handed over from the external data source to DD2, and we thus have relevant data on (a subset of) the individuals in DD2. Currently, we have agreements with the following external data sources:\n\nDDDA (udgår)\nDDiD (nyt, endnu ingen aftale)\nFodstatus\nDiabase (øjenkompl., aftale?)\n\nThe general idea is that we can get updates of data from these data sources. Therefore, we will have the most recent data on the individuals in DD2 and also have updated data whenever we have new individuals in the DD2 cohort.\n\n\nDanish medical registry data\nDD2 research data will be uploaded to the servers hosted at Danmarks Statistik (DST, Statistics Denmark) and Sundhedsdatastyrelsen (SDS, The Danish Health Data Authority). On these servers, we have access to Danish medical registry data, such as data from the CPR registry, hospital data from LPR, laboratory data from LAB-F etc.\n\nSDS\nDST"

    "text": "The full DD2 research data is based on data collected/linked from multiple sources. This page is intended to give an overview of the data structure, the data sources and the definitions of data types. Detailed description of each of the data sources can be found on the following pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHusk at vi i stedet for at kalde det “additional dd2 data” har valgt at kalde det “internal dd2 data”. Så vil vi have core data (data fra index), internal data (det det kun bor i dd2), og external data (det der kommer fra anden kilde)\n\n\n\nDD2 core data\nDD2 core data include the data that make the foundation of DD2. This includes\n\nDD2 questionnaire data\nBiomarker data (analysis results based on the blood and urine samples from time of enrollment). The blood/urine samples are stored in a biobank in Vejle.\n\nTo be enrolled in DD2, the individual fills out the DD2 questionnaire and a blood/urine sample is collected. The core data only exist in DD2 and the DD2 cohort is defined to be those who enrolled in the DD2 by answering the DD2 questionnaire. As the blood/urine samples are collected at enrollment and currently stored in a biobank, it holds potential for additional biomarker analyses, genetic analyses, DNA sequencing etc., which would only add to the core data.\n\n\nInternal DD2 data\nInternal DD2 data include data from additional questionnaires and/or substudies. This includes data only available through DD2, meaning that it is data that had been generated only among individuals in DD2, but it was (probably) not collected as part of the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., include\n\nIDNC questionnaire data, a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.\nBirth data from Rigsarkivet collected from midwife journals. Data (i.e., midwife journals) exist outside DD2 and could thus be considered external data, but it has only been registered electronically for individuals in DD2. For now, we consider it additional DD2 data as it is currently only (practically) available for individuals in DD2.\nIDA, DICTA, CsubT2D, etc., are examples of projects initiated within DD2. These projects generate their own additional data and analyses but data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.\n\nThese data sources will probably not be updated with new individuals or additional data, as they are mostly generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts. Some of the substudies additionally contribute core data as they include analyses made on the blood/urine sample collected at enrollment.\n\n\nData extracts from external data sources\nData from external data sources were not initially generated with the intention to be included in DD2. However, as data can be considered relevant for DD2 research questions, we have linked data from these external data sources to the DD2. In practice, this means that data (or a subset of data) has been handed over from the external data source to DD2, and we thus have relevant data on (a subset of) the individuals in DD2. Currently, we have agreements with the following external data sources:\n\nDDDA (udgår)\nDDiD (nyt, endnu ingen aftale)\nFodstatus\nDiabase (øjenkompl., aftale?)\n\nThe general idea is that we can get updates of data from these data sources. Therefore, we will have the most recent data on the individuals in DD2 and also have updated data whenever we have new individuals in the DD2 cohort.\n\n\nDanish medical registry data\nDD2 research data will be uploaded to the servers hosted at Danmarks Statistik (DST, Statistics Denmark) and Sundhedsdatastyrelsen (SDS, The Danish Health Data Authority). On these servers, we have access to Danish medical registry data, such as data from the CPR registry, hospital data from LPR, laboratory data from LAB-F etc.\n\nSDS\nDST"
